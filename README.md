# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to My Digital Space

So... you found my personal website repository! I'm Saleh, a Saudi programmer from Al-Qassim - yes, the land of the sweetest dates 🌴 - who loves turning ideas into code. This little corner of the internet is where I showcase who I am and what I'm passionate about.

## 🚀 **[Visit My Live Website](https://2saleh1.github.io/personal-website/)** 🚀

## What You'll Find Here 🌟

I built this website to be more than just another boring portfolio. It's got some cool stuff:

- **Bilingual Magic**: Switch between English and Arabic - because I'm proud of both languages! 🇸🇦
- **Smooth Animations**: Everything moves nicely because... why not make it pretty?
- **My Story**: About me, what I love doing, and yes - I'm a football fan ⚽
- **Skills That Actually Matter**: Real percentages of what I know (no fake 100% everywhere!)
- **My Certificates**: The achievements I'm actually proud of
- **Multiple Ways to Stalk Me**: Just kidding! But seriously, all my contact info is there

## The Tech Stuff (For Fellow Nerds) 🛠️

Built this with:
- **HTML5** - The foundation (obviously)
- **CSS3** - Made it pretty with gradients and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks needed, just pure JS magic
- **A Saudi Flag Video** - Because patriotism! 🇸🇦

## 🤫 Psst... Secret Menu Unlocked!

Okay, so I may have hidden some Easter eggs in the website. Don't tell everyone, but here's how to find them:

### The Hidden Superpowers 🎮

**Matrix Mode** 🟢  
Press **M** and watch the magic happen. Yes, like THAT Matrix!

**Glitch in the System** ⚡  
Hit **G** for some cyberpunk vibes. Your screen might have a seizure (in a good way).

**The Ancient Code** 
Remember the Konami Code? **↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A**  
Do it. Thank me later.

**Profile Picture Shenanigans** 🔮  
Click my face. Keep clicking. Trust me.

**Dancing Interests** 💃  
Those interest items? They're clickable. They like to party.

**Cursor Magic** ✨  
Move your mouse around. See those little dots? You're welcome.

### Pro Gamer Tips 🎯
- Matrix effect looks INSANE in fullscreen
- The Konami code works anywhere on the site
- Language preference saves automatically (because I'm thoughtful like that)
- Scroll speed changes the parallax - physics!
